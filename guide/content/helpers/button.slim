title: Button helpers

p.govuk-body
  | In addition to the components, this gem also comes with button helpers that
    are frequently duplicated and reimplemented across projects.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Regular button",
  code: govuk_button_to_normal) do

  p.govuk-body
    | The <code>govuk_button_to</code> helper wraps Rails'
      #{link_to('button_to', rails_docs_button_to).html_safe}
      directly, rendering a form that will <code>POST</code> by default.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Link styled like a button",
  code: govuk_button_link_to_normal) do

  p.govuk-body
    | When using buttons for navigation, we usually want a link styled like a
      button instead.

== render('/partials/example.*',
  caption: "Other button styles",
  code: govuk_button_other_styles) do

  markdown:
    ### Secondary buttons

    Secondary buttons are created with `secondary: true`. Pages usually have
    one primary call to action so secondary buttons are used for other
    operations.

    ### Warning buttons

    Warning buttons are created with `warning: true`. They're designed to make
    users think carefully before they use them. They only work if used very
    sparingly. Most services should not need one.
